# This repo is the official implementation with PyTorch library  for Learning Representations by Contrastive Spatio-Temporal Clustering for Skeleton-based Action Recognition. The paper has been submitted to IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (major revision).
 
Note: We only provide the code of some core modules of the proposed network. The rest will be provided after the paper is accepted. Before the code is fully open source, if readers have any questions, please contact the first author with email: wmingdao@bupt.edu.cn.
