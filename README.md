# CSTCN
This repo is the official implementation with PyTorch library  for Learning Representations by Contrastive Spatio-Temporal Clustering for Skeleton-based Action Recognition (CSTCN). The paper has been submitted to IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (major revision).
 
Note: We only provide the code of some core modules of the CSTCN. The rest will be provided after the paper is accepted. Before the code is fully open source, if readers have any questions, please contact the first author with email: zhangyuereal@163.com.

## Visualization
The changes in the embeddings and Normalized Mutual Information between our CSTCN and CMD during training. For the sake of intuition, we show the results after the 100th epoch, which is the second training stage in our method.
